This project is a cybersecurity incident dashboard built using Streamlit. It provides real-time monitoring, AI-driven threat analysis, and secure authentication using Zero-Knowledge Proofs. The dashboard visualizes cybersecurity metrics, tracks incidents, and fetches live threat intelligence feeds. It also includes an AI-based severity prediction system and an interactive reporting tool to enhance security awareness and response.
